### Predictive Keyboard Model---- Using PyTorch 


The task of building keyboard model include these steps:

1. Tokenize and prepare natural language data
2. Building a vocabulary and converting words to indices
3. Training a next-word predictive model using PyTorch
4. Generating top-k predictions 

By using these steps, a model generating next three words is built, just like a predictive keyboard in your smartphone.
